This is a mockup of a visualization interface based on ParaView for the 
Mantid project. The CMake system does not use the build_paraview_client since 
the code is due to be embedded into the MantidPlot GUI.

To run the program effectively, the Mantid ParaView plugins need to be brought
in by the following process. A directory should be created that contains 
symbolic links to the Mantid ParaView plugins. Next, the PV_PLUGIN_PATH 
environmental variable needs to be set. After this, the MANTIDPATH 
environmental variable needs to be set to the location of the actual plugin 
libraries. Once these three steps are completed, the PVMockupGui executable 
should function properly.
